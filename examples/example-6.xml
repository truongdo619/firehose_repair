       Example of a failure-to-analyze in which we have an error message
       and a location, but other failure fields (stdout, returncode)
       wouldn't make sense and so are omitted.

       The error message is a warning from cpychecker that the results
       are only a partial analysis; it's not achieving full coverage.

       (this was added to cpychecker in:
          http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/gcc-python-plugin.git/commit/?h=firehose&id=1fbb678bb121099a8161031aae9e39c75e3faea7 )
